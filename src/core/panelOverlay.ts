/**
 * Which resize handles a placement offers.
 *
 * **Free-floating:** all eight. Nothing is pinned.
 *
 * **Docked:** only the edges that can actually move. A docked widget pins one edge per axis,
 * so a handle on a pinned side would move the *opposite* edge instead of the one under the
 * cursor — an inert stub with a resize cursor on it. rdd hardcoded the five non-northern
 * directions regardless of anchor, which looked harmless for top anchors but left every
 * bottom-anchored widget with no working vertical resize at all: `n` was not rendered, and
 * `s` was the stub.
 *
 * **Stretched:** a stretched axis has both ends pinned, but both are *releasable* — dragging
 * either moves that edge and pins the opposite one. So it offers handles on both ends, which
 * is also what keeps the fully-stretched state from being a dead end with nothing to grab.
 * The corner belongs only to the all-pinned state; in a stretched state it would mix a
 * resize and a release into one gesture.
 *
 * The block axis is direction-agnostic; the inline axis is not. The pin is a logical property
 * (`inset-inline-end`) while the handle classes are physical (`.vdd-resize-e { right: 0 }`),
 * so which *physical* side is pinned depends on the reading direction.
