 * writing on "a bound was exceeded" rather than on "a value changed" re-triggers the watcher
 * forever. Both clamps have a floor, so in a workspace narrower than that floor the clamped
 * value still fails its own condition — and the rewrite loop that produced was found by
 * M13's browser tour as "Maximum recursive updates exceeded".
 *
 * Size is clamped for every window. Position is clamped only for a free-floating one: an
 * anchored window is placed entirely by its anchor and reading direction, so its stored x/y
 * do not affect where it appears.
