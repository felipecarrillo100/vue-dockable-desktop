/**
 * The stretch algebra for docked inner widgets.
 *
 * A docked widget normally pins one end of each axis and carries an explicit size. A
 * *stretched* axis pins **both** ends and carries no size at all, so the widget tracks its
 * panel as the panel resizes — with no ResizeObserver and no JavaScript, because CSS
 * already does exactly this. "Full width" is not a width; it is a second pin.
 *
 * Pure functions over two values, so the nine placements (three inline states × three
 * block states, minus the impossible) are testable without a DOM.

 * that edge and pushes whatever is stacked in either.
 *
 * A block-stretched widget spans the very axis stacking uses to separate siblings, so it
 * cannot participate at all and occupies no bucket — z-order decides any overlap.

 * during a resize drag, so widgets would reshuffle mid-gesture.
